README = "This is the M5 simulator.\n\nFor detailed information about building the simulator and getting\nstarted please refer to http://www.m5sim.org.\n\nSpecific pages of interest are:\nhttp://www.m5sim.org/wiki/index.php/Compiling_M5\nhttp://www.m5sim.org/wiki/index.php/Running_M5\n\nShort version:\n\n1. If you don't have SCons version 0.98.1 or newer, get it from\nhttp://wwww.scons.org.\n\n2. If you don't have SWIG version 1.3.31 or newer, get it from\nhttp://wwww.swig.org.\n\n3. Make sure you also have gcc version 3.4.6 or newer, Python 2.4 or newer\n(the dev version with header files), zlib, and the m4 preprocessor.\n\n4. In this directory, type 'scons build/ALPHA_SE/tests/debug/quick'.  This\nwill build the debug version of the m5 binary (m5.debug) for the Alpha\nsyscall emulation target, and run the quick regression tests on it.\n\nIf you have questions, please send mail to m5-users@m5sim.org\n\nWHAT'S INCLUDED (AND NOT)\n-------------------------\n\nThe basic source release includes these subdirectories:\n - m5:\n   - configs: simulation configuration scripts\n   - ext: less-common external packages needed to build m5\n   - src: source code of the m5 simulator\n   - system: source for some optional system software for simulated systems\n   - tests: regression tests\n   - util: useful utility programs and files\n\nTo run full-system simulations, you will need compiled system firmware\n(console and PALcode for Alpha), kernel binaries and one or more disk images. \nThese files for Alpha are collected in a separate archive, m5_system.tar.bz2.\nThis file can he downloaded separately.\n\nDepending on the ISA used, M5 may support Linux 2.4/2.6, FreeBSD, and the\nproprietary Compaq/HP Tru64 version of Unix. We are able to distribute Linux\nand FreeBSD bootdisks, but we are unable to distribute bootable disk images of\nTru64 Unix. If you have a Tru64 license and are interested in\nobtaining disk images, contact us at m5-users@m5sim.org\n"
